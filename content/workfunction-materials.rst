Introduction
-------------

Standard semiconductor physics textbooks define work function somewhat vaguely, 
which only brings out part of the physical significance of the term.

> Work function is the difference between the Fermi level :math:`E_F` and the vacuum level :math:`E_0`,
> where the vacuum level is the energy state of electrons outside the material.

In this article, we will elaborate on this definition, especially some subtle points on the definition of the **vacuum level**.

# Work Function of a Metal
----------------------------

Before moving to semiconductors, we will first consider a metal.
Consider an electron inside a metal at the Fermi level.
Now, bring the electron *just* outside the metal. 
The electron should be brought far enough so that it no longer experiences any forces due to the metal's atoms / chemical structure.
